							<h2>Where is the Tundra?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The Tundra biome usually found near the north of the globe around the latitudes of sixty to seventy degrees. The Tundra make up most of Canada and Russia.</p>

							<h2>What are they like year round?</h2>
						</header>
						<p><span class="12u"><img src="images/graph.png" alt="" /></span>The Tundra biome recieves little rain during the winter months. It also has very low temperatures throughout the year with the height of Summer is around nineteen degrees. The reason the Tundra biome is the way it is is because of the latitude of the biome. This causes a lack of direct sunlight resulting in deprived heat leading to heavy snow and frozen rivers and seas. The lack of warmth and sunlight has made the water and snow very dificult to evaporate and create rainfall, this is the reason why rainfall in the Tundra biome is significantly lower than other countries such as England and China.This leaves only a small window of which life could be sustained. Leading on to the next topic: wildife.</p>

							<h2>Life in the Tundra Biome</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>The Arctic Fox</h3>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/arctic_fox.jpg" alt="" /></span>The arctic fox is one among many Tundra animals, it has adapted to have a white winter coat to camoflauge with the snow and thick inner fur to insulate the fox's body. The arctic fox has also undergone many behavioural changes. One of them include the fox's method of hunting, where it uses its ears to sense its prey beneath the snow and will then pounce paws first into the snow. The Arctic fox is also very endangered.</p>
						<h3>The Arctic Woolly Bear Catapillar</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/wbc.jpg" alt="" /></span>The arctic woolly bear catapillar is extremely different to other insects with an increadible lifespan of around fifteen years. However the arctic woolly bear catapillar's lifespan is not its most different feature as the catapillar has learned to effectively kill itslef during the winter months and then revives itself during the summer months. The woolly bear catapillar is commonly found near the noth of Canada and is harmless to people. At the end of its life as a catapillar it creates a cocoon that keeps the catapillar warm while it turns into a moth.</p>
						<h3>The Wolverine</h3>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/wlv.jpg" alt="" /></span> The wolverine is another predator found in the Tundra. Do not think the wolverine will not attack you as it is very common to see a wolverine fight bears for territory and are extremely agressive. The wolverine has a thick warm coat and very large canines to keep warm and to easilly eat heir prey.</p>

							<h2>Vegetation in the Tundra Biome</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>Labrador Tea</h3>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/ltf.jpg" alt="" /></span>A plant in this harsh biome is the Labrador Tea. The Labrador Tea has red leaves that use chlorophyll and the sun to create heat. This plant also has a hairy stem to keep itself warm. No animal eats the Labrador Tea furthermore, this plant is also only found in the Tundra biome.</p>
						<h3>The Diamond Leaf Willow</h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/dlf.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						Another plant that can be found in the Tundra biome is the Diamond leaf willow. It has green leaves and small round twigs that are soft and bend easily. Just like many of the other plants in the Tundra, it has a hairy stem and stays close to the ground to keep as warm as possible. Animals and people eat this because it has a lot of vitamin C, vitamin A, and Calcium. It is not as common as the other plants because so many people and animals eat it.</p>

						<h3>Natural Resources</h3>
						<p>In the arctic Tundra there are many different minerals. The most common of which are diamonds, antimony and uranium. Oil can also be found in the harsh Tundra biome and because of these resources, more and more people and moving to the Tundra ares to work in new mines and drilling stations. In the Tundra biome there are large scientific programs goin on all the time, this is because of the arctic permafrost usually around six inches below the surface and this permafrost preserves ancient wildlife and bubbles that can date as far as seven thousand years ago leading to new atmospheric studies and discoveries.</p>
						<h3>Recreation and Tourism</h3>
						<p>Because the Tundra biome is so untouched, there has not been many tourism and recreational activities avaliable in the tundra. But sightseeing bus drives are common where people can see polar and sometimes grizzly bears.	</p>

							<h2>Threats to the tundra biome</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>How we are affecting it</h3>
						<p>In the arctic Tundra as a result of the increase in mines, infastructure, oil drills and buildings permafrost is bein damaged and this is threatening the plantlife and upper in the food chain, animals. Another negative cause of these facilities is the damage caused to the food source, lichen which is damaging the population of the native animals.</p>
						<h3>How we can fix it.</h3>
						<p>The Tundra could be saved by giving more consideration about global warming, as well as making way for annual migrations and trying to protect permafrost.</p>
